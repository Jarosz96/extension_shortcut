# extension_shortcut


This project quickly creates shortcuts for files with chosen file extentions from one folder to another, making it easier to use them without moving the files.
This simplifies accessing deeply nested files, saving time and effort.

## How to use

- Add your source and destination directory in the code
- Run it

## Future plans

- Adding multiple layers of filtering (exclude files if... or...)
- Creating subfolders (if multiple python files exists in the same directory)
